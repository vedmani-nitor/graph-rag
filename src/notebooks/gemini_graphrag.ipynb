metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"Often big companies buy startups before they're profitable. Obviously in such cases they're not after revenues. What they want is the development team and the software they've built so far. When a startup gets bought for 2 or 3 million six months in, it's really more of a hiring bonus than an acquisition. I think this sort of thing will happen more and more, and that it will be better for everyone. It's obviously better for the people who start the startup, because they get a big chunk of money up front. But I think it will be better for the acquirers too. The central problem in big companies, and the main reason they're so much less productive than small companies, is the difficulty of valuing each person's work. Buying larval startups solves that problem for them: the acquirer doesn't pay till the developers have proven themselves. Acquirers are protected on the downside, but still get most of the upside. Product Development Buying startups also solves another problem afflicting big companies: they can't do product development. Big companies are good at extracting the value from existing products, but bad at creating new ones. Why? It's worth studying this phenomenon in detail, because this is the raison d'etre of startups. To start with, most big companies have some kind of turf to protect, and this tends to warp their development decisions. For example, Web-based applications are hot now, but within Microsoft there must be a lot of ambivalence about them, because the very idea of Web-based software threatens the desktop. So any Web-based application that Microsoft ends up with, will probably, like Hotmail, be something developed outside the company. Another reason big companies are bad at developing new products is that the kind of people who do that tend not to have much power in big companies (unless they happen to be the CEO). Disruptive technologies are developed by disruptive people. And they either don't work for the big company, or have been outmaneuvered by yes-men and have comparatively little influence. Big companies also lose because they usually only build one of each thing. When you only have one Web browser, you can't do anything really risky with it. If ten different startups design ten different Web browsers and you take the best, you'll probably get something better. The more general version of this problem is that there are too many new ideas for companies to explore them all. There might be 500 startups right now who think they're making something Microsoft might buy. Even Microsoft probably couldn't manage 500 development projects in-house. Big companies also don't pay people the right way. People developing a new product at a big company get paid roughly the same whether it succeeds or fails. People at a startup expect to get rich if the product succeeds, and get nothing if it fails. [ 2 ] So naturally the people at the startup work a lot harder. The mere bigness of big companies is an obstacle. In startups, developers are often forced to talk directly to users, whether they want to or not, because there is no one else to do sales and support. It's painful doing sales, but you learn much more from trying to sell people something than reading what they said in focus groups. And then of course, big companies are bad at product development because they're bad at everything. Everything happens slower in big companies than small ones, and product development is something that has to happen fast, because you have to go through a lot of iterations to get something good. Trend I think the trend of big companies buying startups will only accelerate. One of the biggest remaining obstacles is pride. Most companies, at least unconsciously, feel they ought to be able to develop stuff in house, and that buying startups is to some degree an admission of failure. And so, as people generally do with admissions of failure, they put it off for as long as possible. That makes the acquisition very expensive when it finally happens. What companies should do is go out and discover startups when they're young, before VCs have puffed them up into something that costs hundreds of millions to acquire. Much of what VCs add, the acquirer doesn't need anyway. Why don't acquirers try to predict the companies they're going to have to buy for hundreds of millions, and grab them early for a tenth or a twentieth of that? Because they can't predict the winners in advance? If they're only paying a twentieth as much, they only have to predict a twentieth as well. Surely they can manage that. I think companies that acquire technology will gradually learn to go after earlier stage startups. They won't necessarily buy them outright.\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=4397, end_char_idx=9101, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

outright. The solution may be some hybrid of investment and acquisition: for example, to buy a chunk of the company and get an option to buy the rest later. When companies buy startups, they're effectively fusing recruiting and product development. And I think that's more efficient than doing the two separately, because you always get people who are really committed to what they're working on. Plus this method yields teams of developers who already work well together. Any conflicts between them have been ironed out under the very hot iron of running a startup. By the time the acquirer gets them, they're finishing one another's sentences. That's valuable in software, because so many bugs occur at the boundaries between different people's code. Investors The increasing cheapness of starting a company doesn't just give hackers more power relative to employers. It also gives them more power relative to investors. The conventional wisdom among VCs is that hackers shouldn't be allowed to run their own companies. The founders are supposed to accept MBAs as their bosses, and themselves take on some title like Chief Technical Officer. There may be cases where this is a good idea. But I think founders will increasingly be able to push back in the matter of control, because they just don't need the investors' money as much as they used to. Startups are a comparatively new phenomenon. Fairchild Semiconductor is considered the first VC-backed startup, and they were founded in 1959, less than fifty years ago. Measured on the time scale of social change, what we have now is pre-beta. So we shouldn't assume the way startups work now is the way they have to work. Fairchild needed a lot of money to get started. They had to build actual factories. What does the first round of venture funding for a Web-based startup get spent on today? More money can't get software written faster; it isn't needed for facilities, because those can now be quite cheap; all money can really buy you is sales and marketing. A sales force is worth something, I'll admit. But marketing is increasingly irrelevant. On the Internet, anything genuinely good will spread by word of mouth. Investors' power comes from money. When startups need less money, investors have less power over them. So future founders may not have to accept new CEOs if they don't want them. The VCs will have to be dragged kicking and screaming down this road, but like many things people have to be dragged kicking and screaming toward, it may actually be good for them. Google is a sign of the way things are going. As a condition of funding, their investors insisted they hire someone old and experienced as CEO. But from what I've heard the founders didn't just give in and take whoever the VCs wanted. They delayed for an entire year, and when they did finally take a CEO, they chose a guy with a PhD in computer science. It sounds to me as if the founders are still the most powerful people in the company, and judging by Google's performance, their youth and inexperience doesn't seem to have hurt them. Indeed, I suspect Google has done better than they would have if the founders had given the VCs what they wanted, when they wanted it, and let some MBA take over as soon as they got their first round of funding. I'm not claiming the business guys installed by VCs have no value. Certainly they have. But they don't need to become the founders' bosses, which is what that title CEO means. I predict that in the future the executives installed by VCs will increasingly be COOs rather than CEOs. The founders will run engineering directly, and the rest of the company through the COO. The Open Cage With both employers and investors, the balance of power is slowly shifting towards the young. And yet they seem the last to realize it. Only the most ambitious undergrads even consider starting their own company when they graduate. Most just want to get a job. Maybe this is as it should be. Maybe if the idea of starting a startup is intimidating, you filter out the uncommitted. But I suspect the filter is set a little too high. I think there are people who could, if they tried, start successful startups, and who instead let themselves be swept into the intake ducts of big companies. Have you ever noticed that when animals are let out of cages, they don't always realize at first that the door's open? Often they have to be poked with a stick to get them out.

People could have been publishing online in 1995, and yet blogging has only really taken off in the last couple years. In 1995 we thought only professional writers were entitled to publish their ideas, and that anyone else who did was a crank. Now publishing online is becoming so popular that everyone wants to do it, even print journalists. But blogging has not taken off recently because of any technical innovation; it just took eight years for everyone to realize the cage was open. I think most undergrads don\\'t realize yet that the economic cage is open. A lot have been told by their parents that the route to success is to get a good job. This was true when their parents were in college, but it\\'s less true now. The route to success is to build something valuable, and you don\\'t have to be working for an existing company to do that. Indeed, you can often do it better if you\\'re not. When I talk to undergrads, what surprises me most about them is how conservative they are. Not politically, of course. I mean they don\\'t seem to want to take risks. This is a mistake, because the younger you are, the more risk you can take. Risk Risk and reward are always proportionate. For example, stocks are riskier than bonds, and over time always have greater returns. So why does anyone invest in bonds? The catch is that phrase \"over time.\" Stocks will generate greater returns over thirty years, but they might lose value from year to year. So what you should invest in depends on how soon you need the money. If you\\'re young, you should take the riskiest investments you can find. All this talk about investing may seem very theoretical. Most undergrads probably have more debts than assets. They may feel they have nothing to invest. But that\\'s not true: they have their time to invest, and the same rule about risk applies there. Your early twenties are exactly the time to take insane career risks. The reason risk is always proportionate to reward is that market forces make it so. People will pay extra for stability. So if you choose stability-- by buying bonds, or by going to work for a big company-- it\\'s going to cost you. Riskier career moves pay better on average, because there is less demand for them. Extreme choices like starting a startup are so frightening that most people won\\'t even try. So you don\\'t end up having as much competition as you might expect, considering the prizes at stake. The math is brutal. While perhaps 9 out of 10 startups fail, the one that succeeds will pay the founders more than 10 times what they would have made in an ordinary job. [ 3 ] That\\'s the sense in which startups pay better \"on average.\" Remember that. If you start a startup, you\\'ll probably fail. Most startups fail. It\\'s the nature of the business. But it\\'s not necessarily a mistake to try something that has a 90% chance of failing, if you can afford the risk. Failing at 40, when you have a family to support, could be serious. But if you fail at 22, so what? If you try to start a startup right out of college and it tanks, you\\'ll end up at 23 broke and a lot smarter. Which, if you think about it, is roughly what you hope to get from a graduate program. Even if your startup does tank, you won\\'t harm your prospects with employers. To make sure I asked some friends who work for big companies. I asked managers at Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Cisco and Microsoft how they\\'d feel about two candidates, both 24, with equal ability, one who\\'d tried to start a startup that tanked, and another who\\'d spent the two years since college working as a developer at a big company. Every one responded that they\\'d prefer the guy who\\'d tried to start his own company. Zod Nazem, who\\'s in charge of engineering at Yahoo, said: I actually put more value on the guy with the failed startup. And you can quote me! So there you have it. Want to get hired by Yahoo? Start your own company. The Man is the Customer If even big employers think highly of young hackers who start companies, why don\\'t more do it? Why are undergrads so conservative? I think it\\'s because they\\'ve spent so much time in institutions. The first twenty years of everyone\\'s life consists of being piped from one institution to another.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=13530, end_char_idx=17773, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

life consists of being piped from one institution to another. You probably didn\\'t have much choice about the secondary schools you went to. And after high school it was probably understood that you were supposed to go to college. You may have had a few different colleges to choose between, but they were probably pretty similar. So by this point you\\'ve been riding on a subway line for twenty years, and the next stop seems to be a job. Actually college is where the line ends. Superficially, going to work for a company may feel like just the next in a series of institutions, but underneath, everything is different. The end of school is the fulcrum of your life, the point where you go from net consumer to net producer. The other big change is that now, you\\'re steering. You can go anywhere you want. So it may be worth standing back and understanding what\\'s going on, instead of just doing the default thing. All through college, and probably long before that, most undergrads have been thinking about what employers want. But what really matters is what customers want, because they\\'re the ones who give employers the money to pay you. So instead of thinking about what employers want, you\\'re probably better off thinking directly about what users want. To the extent there\\'s any difference between the two, you can even use that to your advantage if you start a company of your own. For example, big companies like docile conformists. But this is merely an artifact of their bigness, not something customers need. Grad School I didn\\'t consciously realize all this when I was graduating from college-- partly because I went straight to grad school. Grad school can be a pretty good deal, even if you think of one day starting a startup. You can start one when you\\'re done, or even pull the ripcord part way through, like the founders of Yahoo and Google. Grad school makes a good launch pad for startups, because you\\'re collected together with a lot of smart people, and you have bigger chunks of time to work on your own projects than an undergrad or corporate employee would. As long as you have a fairly tolerant advisor, you can take your time developing an idea before turning it into a company. David Filo and Jerry Yang started the Yahoo directory in February 1994 and were getting a million hits a day by the fall, but they didn\\'t actually drop out of grad school and start a company till March 1995. You could also try the startup first, and if it doesn\\'t work, then go to grad school. When startups tank they usually do it fairly quickly. Within a year you\\'ll know if you\\'re wasting your time. If it fails, that is. If it succeeds, you may have to delay grad school a little longer. But you\\'ll have a much more enjoyable life once there than you would on a regular grad student stipend. Experience Another reason people in their early twenties don\\'t start startups is that they feel they don\\'t have enough experience. Most investors feel the same. I remember hearing a lot of that word \"experience\" when I was in college. What do people really mean by it? Obviously it\\'s not the experience itself that\\'s valuable, but something it changes in your brain. What\\'s different about your brain after you have \"experience,\" and can you make that change happen faster? I now have some data on this, and I can tell you what tends to be missing when people lack experience. I\\'ve said that every startup needs three things: to start with good people, to make something users want, and not to spend too much money. It\\'s the middle one you get wrong when you\\'re inexperienced. There are plenty of undergrads with enough technical skill to write good software, and undergrads are not especially prone to waste money. If they get something wrong, it\\'s usually not realizing they have to make something people want This is not exclusively a failing of the young. It\\'s common for startup founders of all ages to build things no one wants. Fortunately, this flaw should be easy to fix. If undergrads were all bad programmers, the problem would be a lot harder. It can take years to learn how to program. But I don\\'t think it takes years to learn how to make things people want. My hypothesis is that all you have to do is smack hackers on the side of the head and tell them: Wake up. Don\\'t sit here making up a priori theories about what users need. Go find some users and see what they need.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=17675, end_char_idx=22103, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Go find some users and see what they need. Most successful startups not only do something very specific, but solve a problem people already know they have. The big change that \"experience\" causes in your brain is learning that you need to solve people\\'s problems. Once you grasp that, you advance quickly to the next step, which is figuring out what those problems are. And that takes some effort, because the way software actually gets used, especially by the people who pay the most for it, is not at all what you might expect. For example, the stated purpose of Powerpoint is to present ideas. Its real role is to overcome people\\'s fear of public speaking. It allows you to give an impressive-looking talk about nothing, and it causes the audience to sit in a dark room looking at slides, instead of a bright one looking at you. This kind of thing is out there for anyone to see. The key is to know to look for it-- to realize that having an idea for a startup is not like having an idea for a class project. The goal in a startup is not to write a cool piece of software. It\\'s to make something people want. And to do that you have to look at users-- forget about hacking, and just look at users. This can be quite a mental adjustment, because little if any of the software you write in school even has users. A few steps before a Rubik\\'s Cube is solved, it still looks like a mess. I think there are a lot of undergrads whose brains are in a similar position: they\\'re only a few steps away from being able to start successful startups, if they wanted to, but they don\\'t realize it. They have more than enough technical skill. They just haven\\'t realized yet that the way to create wealth is to make what users want, and that employers are just proxies for users in which risk is pooled. If you\\'re young and smart, you don\\'t need either of those. You don\\'t need someone else to tell you what users want, because you can figure it out yourself. And you don\\'t want to pool risk, because the younger you are, the more risk you should take. A Public Service Message I\\'d like to conclude with a joint message from me and your parents. Don\\'t drop out of college to start a startup. There\\'s no rush. There will be plenty of time to start companies after you graduate. In fact, it may be just as well to go work for an existing company for a couple years after you graduate, to learn how companies work. And yet, when I think about it, I can\\'t imagine telling Bill Gates at 19 that he should wait till he graduated to start a company. He\\'d have told me to get lost. And could I have honestly claimed that he was harming his future-- that he was learning less by working at ground zero of the microcomputer revolution than he would have if he\\'d been taking classes back at Harvard? No, probably not. And yes, while it is probably true that you\\'ll learn some valuable things by going to work for an existing company for a couple years before starting your own, you\\'d learn a thing or two running your own company during that time too. The advice about going to work for someone else would get an even colder reception from the 19 year old Bill Gates. So I\\'m supposed to finish college, then go work for another company for two years, and then I can start my own? I have to wait till I\\'m 23? That\\'s four years That\\'s more than twenty percent of my life so far. Plus in four years it will be way too late to make money writing a Basic interpreter for the Altair. And he\\'d be right. The Apple II was launched just two years later. In fact, if Bill had finished college and gone to work for another company as we\\'re suggesting, he might well have gone to work for Apple. And while that would probably have been better for all of us, it wouldn\\'t have been better for him. So while I stand by our responsible advice to finish college and then go work for a while before starting a startup, I have to admit it\\'s one of those things the old tell the young, but don\\'t expect them to listen to. We say this sort of thing mainly so we can claim we warned you. So don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you. Notes [ 1 ] The average B-17 pilot in World War II was in his early twenties.

metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='April 2021 Every year since 1982, Forbes magazine has published a list of the richest Americans. If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to the 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences. In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the 100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10 du Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes. Why would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance taxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this period. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more people are making them. How are people making these new fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting companies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56 derive from founders\\' or early employees\\' equity (52 founders, 2 early employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managing investment funds. There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982. Hedge funds and private equity firms existed in 1982, but none of their founders were rich enough yet to make it into the top 100. Two things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generate high returns, and more investors were willing to trust them with their money. [ 1 ] But the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, and when you look at the data, you see big changes there too. People get richer from starting companies now than they did in 1982, because the companies do different things. In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and real estate. Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due primarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number are: of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2 to oil. By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes called \"tech\" companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive from such companies. These are particularly common among the richest of the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of this type. Arguably it\\'s slightly misleading to treat tech as a category. Isn\\'t Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no. Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it won\\'t seem right to put these two businesses in the same category. But at the moment at least, there is definitely something they share in common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? What car maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company? The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a well-differentiated group in the sense that they\\'re all companies that venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others mostly not. And there\\'s a reason why: these are mostly companies that win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who\\'s really driven and good at making deals. To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative change. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400 didn\\'t win by making better technology. They won by being really driven and good at making deals. [ 2 ] And indeed, that way of getting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution. The courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of European royal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule, really driven and good at making deals. People who don\\'t look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn\\'t get as rich. But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don\\'t look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies? Why are people starting so many more new companies than they used to, and why are they getting so rich from it? The answer to the first question, curiously enough, is that it\\'s misphrased.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4120, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

are starting companies, but why they\\'re starting companies again [ 3 ] In 1892, the New York Herald Tribune compiled a list of all the millionaires in America. They found 4047 of them. How many had inherited their wealth then? Only about 20%, which is less than the proportion of heirs today. And when you investigate the sources of the new fortunes, 1892 looks even more like today. Hugh Rockoff found that \"many of the richest.. gained their initial edge from the new technology of mass production.\" [ 4 ] So it\\'s not 2020 that\\'s the anomaly here, but 1982. The real question is why so few people had gotten rich from starting companies in 1982. And the answer is that even as the Herald Tribune \\'s list was being compiled, a wave of consolidation was sweeping through the American economy. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, financiers like J. P. Morgan combined thousands of smaller companies into a few hundred giant ones with commanding economies of scale. By the end of World War II, as Michael Lind writes, \"the major sectors of the economy were either organized as government-backed cartels or dominated by a few oligopolistic corporations.\" [ 5 ] In 1960, most of the people who start startups today would have gone to work for one of them. You could get rich from starting your own company in 1890 and in 2020, but in 1960 it was not really a viable option. You couldn\\'t break through the oligopolies to get at the markets. So the prestigious route in 1960 was not to start your own company, but to work your way up the corporate ladder at an existing one. [ 6 ] Making everyone a corporate employee decreased economic inequality (and every other kind of variation), but if your model of normal is the mid 20th century, you have a very misleading model in that respect. J. P. Morgan\\'s economy turned out to be just a phase, and starting in the 1970s, it began to break up. Why did it break up? Partly senescence. The big companies that seemed models of scale and efficiency in 1930 had by 1970 become slack and bloated. By 1970 the rigid structure of the economy was full of cosy nests that various groups had built to insulate themselves from market forces. During the Carter administration the federal government realized something was amiss and began, in a process they called \"deregulation,\" to roll back the policies that propped up the oligopolies. But it wasn\\'t just decay from within that broke up J. P. Morgan\\'s economy. There was also pressure from without, in the form of new technology, and particularly microelectronics. The best way to envision what happened is to imagine a pond with a crust of ice on top. Initially the only way from the bottom to the surface is around the edges. But as the ice crust weakens, you start to be able to punch right through the middle. The edges of the pond were pure tech: companies that actually described themselves as being in the electronics or software business. When you used the word \"startup\" in 1990, that was what you meant. But now startups are punching right through the middle of the ice crust and displacing incumbents like retailers and TV networks and car companies. [ 7 ] But though the breakup of J. P. Morgan\\'s economy created a new world in the technological sense, it was a reversion to the norm in the social sense. If you only look back as far as the mid 20th century, it seems like people getting rich by starting their own companies is a recent phenomenon. But if you look back further, you realize it\\'s actually the default. So what we should expect in the future is more of the same. Indeed, we should expect both the number and wealth of founders to grow, because every decade it gets easier to start a startup. Part of the reason it\\'s getting easier to start a startup is social. Society is (re)assimilating the concept. If you start one now, your parents won\\'t freak out the way they would have a generation ago, and knowledge about how to do it is much more widespread. But the main reason it\\'s easier to start a startup now is that it\\'s cheaper. Technology has driven down the cost of both building products and acquiring customers. The decreasing cost of starting a startup has in turn changed the balance of power between founders and investors.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=4121, end_char_idx=8401, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text='Back when starting a startup meant building a factory, you needed investors\\' permission to do it at all. But now investors need founders more than founders need investors, and that, combined with the increasing amount of venture capital available, has driven up valuations. [ 8 ] So the decreasing cost of starting a startup increases the number of rich people in two ways: it means that more people start them, and that those who do can raise money on better terms. But there\\'s also a third factor at work: the companies themselves are more valuable, because newly founded companies grow faster than they used to. Technology hasn\\'t just made it cheaper to build and distribute things, but faster too. This trend has been running for a long time. IBM, founded in 1896, took 45 years to reach a billion 2020 dollars in revenue. Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, founded in 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is 7 or 8 years. [ 9 ] Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders\\' stock. The value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth rate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion dollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when it reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower. That\\'s why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The low initial cost of starting a startup means founders can start young, and the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeed they could be surprisingly rich just a few years later. It\\'s easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been. That means more people start them, that those who do get better terms from investors, and that the resulting companies become more valuable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that startups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don\\'t have to resort to some vague right turn the country took under Reagan to explain why America\\'s Gini coefficient is increasing. Of course the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting more valuable companies, how could it not be? Notes [ 1 ] Investment firms grew rapidly after a regulatory change by the Labor Department in 1978 allowed pension funds to invest in them, but the effects of this growth were not yet visible in the top 100 fortunes in 1982. [ 2 ] George Mitchell deserves mention as an exception. Though really driven and good at making deals, he was also the first to figure out how to use fracking to get natural gas out of shale. [ 3 ] When I say people are starting more companies, I mean the type of company meant to grow very big. There has actually been a decrease in the last couple decades in the overall number of new companies. But the vast majority of companies are small retail and service businesses. So what the statistics about the decreasing number of new businesses mean is that people are starting fewer shoe stores and barber shops. People sometimes get confused when they see a graph labelled \"startups\" that\\'s going down, because there are two senses of the word \"startup\": (1) the founding of a company, and (2) a particular type of company designed to grow big fast. The statistics mean startup in sense (1), not sense (2). [ 4 ] Rockoff, Hugh. \"Great Fortunes of the Gilded Age.\" NBER Working Paper 14555, 2008. [ 5 ] Lind, Michael. Land of Promise. HarperCollins, 2012. It\\'s also likely that the high tax rates in the mid 20th century deterred people from starting their own companies. Starting one\\'s own company is risky, and when risk isn\\'t rewarded, people opt for safety instead. But it wasn\\'t simply cause and effect. The oligopolies and high tax rates of the mid 20th century were all of a piece. Lower taxes are not just a cause of entrepreneurship, but an effect as well: the people getting rich in the mid 20th century from real estate and oil exploration lobbied for and got huge tax loopholes that made their effective tax rate much lower, and presumably if it had been more common to grow big companies by building new technology, the people doing that would have lobbied for their own loopholes as well. [ 6 ] That\\'s why the people who did get rich in the mid 20th century so often got rich from oil exploration or real estate. Those were the two big areas of the economy that weren\\'t susceptible to consolidation.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=8402, end_char_idx=12778, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'),\n",

weren\\'t susceptible to consolidation. [ 7 ] The pure tech companies used to be called \"high technology\" startups. But now that startups can punch through the middle of the ice crust, we don\\'t need a separate name for the edges, and the term \"high-tech\" has a decidedly retro sound. [ 8 ] Higher valuations mean you either sell less stock to get a given amount of money, or get more money for a given amount of stock. The typical startup does some of each. Obviously you end up richer if you keep more stock, but you should also end up richer if you raise more money, because (a) it should make the company more successful, and (b) you should be able to last longer before the next round, or not even need one. Notice all those shoulds though. In practice a lot of money slips through them. It might seem that the huge rounds raised by startups nowadays contradict the claim that it has become cheaper to start one. But there\\'s no contradiction here; the startups that raise the most are the ones doing it by choice, in order to grow faster, not the ones doing it because they need the money to survive. There\\'s nothing like not needing money to make people offer it to you. You would think, after having been on the side of labor in its fight with capital for almost two centuries, that the far left would be happy that labor has finally prevailed. But none of them seem to be. You can almost hear them saying \"No, no, not that way.\" [ 9 ] IBM was created in 1911 by merging three companies, the most important of which was Herman Hollerith\\'s Tabulating Machine Company, founded in 1896. In 1941 its revenues were $60 million. Hewlett-Packard\\'s revenues in 1964 were $125 million. Microsoft\\'s revenues in 1988 were $590 million.

       "Response(response='Startups are judged by their users and may be limited by market size.  They work on technology, thrive in startup hubs, and are designed for growth.  They are characterized by low costs, blurred work-life boundaries, and frequent failures.  Startups pose financial risks, require funding and intense work, and involve dealing with challenges. They hire people, launch during YC, and may transition to VC firms.  Their outcomes range from wealth to failure.  They are not designed for adversity, lack office hours, and often grow out of schools.  Many are located in the Bay Area, Boston, or Seattle, and may fail within a year.  They need someone focused on customer needs and a large market to succeed by creating wealth.  They offer solutions to financial problems and may affect academic career prospects.  They provide time efficiency.  Successful startups are usually started by multiple people and may receive acquisition offers; they may also experience near-financial ruin and reduce the desire for academic positions.\\n', source_nodes=[NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='83f882dd-1f0b-4cdf-b1d8-15a2d788efbe', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': \"D:\\\\projects\\\\graphrag-poc\\\\data\\\\selection 1\\\\A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_name': \"A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 35856, 'creation_date': '2024-11-26', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='39dbe197-686f-4596-9478-0f4eb1a4350a', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': \"D:\\\\projects\\\\graphrag-poc\\\\data\\\\selection 1\\\\A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_name': \"A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 35856, 'creation_date': '2024-11-26', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-20'}, hash='c93d2695e878542a3875974944596c8b180c2788d87dcb71a104c6ec2a8753c2'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='aa827ddf-ff02-46cf-9ba3-75b9becbbb7b', node_type='1', metadata={'file_path': \"D:\\\\projects\\\\graphrag-poc\\\\data\\\\selection 1\\\\A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_name': \"A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 35856, 'creation_date': '2024-11-26', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-20'}, hash='3cc3de9fc229e67bfe41382a1f0ce2730ccb675bb91b435d1a14771f0158181a'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='54d15917-8683-410b-a7a0-4ebb730a397a', node_type='1', metadata={}, hash='ad215a98214335ccc7d8c93d2cf882ba6ed1433d287bc58de7bd54a049807684')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\\n\\nStartups -> JUDGE_BY -> Users\\nStartups -> HAVE_ADVANTAGE -> lack of discrimination laws\\nStartups -> MAY_BE_LIMITED_BY -> market size\\nStartups -> WORK_ON -> technology\\nStartups -> THRIVE_IN -> startup hubs\\nStartups -> DESIGNED_FOR -> growth\\nStartups -> CHARACTERIZED_BY -> low cost\\nStartups -> POSE -> financial risk\\nStartups -> HIRE -> people\\nStartups -> LAUNCH -> during YC\\nStartups -> PLAY_GAME_WITH_OUTCOMES -> wealth or failure\\nStartups -> REQUIRE -> funding\\nStartups -> NOT_DESIGNED_FOR -> adversity\\nStartups -> TRANSITION_TO -> VC firms\\nStartups -> PRESENT -> what they've got so far\\nStartups -> LACK -> office hours\\nStartups -> GROW_OUT_OF -> schools\\nStartups -> LOCATED_IN -> Bay Area, Boston, or Seattle\\nStartups -> FAIL_WITHIN -> a year\\nStartups -> INVOLVE -> dealing with challenges\\nStartups -> SUCCEED_BY -> Creating wealth\\nStartups -> NEED -> someone focused on customer needs\\nStartups -> CHARACTERIZED_BY -> blurred work-life boundaries\\nStartups -> RUN_OUT_OF -> money\\nStartups -> OFFER -> solution to financial problems\\nStartups -> REQUIRE -> intense work\\nStartups -> CHARACTERIZED_BY -> frequent failures\\nStartups -> MAY_AFFECT -> academic career prospects\\nStartups -> PROVIDE -> time efficiency\\nStartups -> NEED -> large market\\n\\nAnd that is another area where undergrads have an edge. They're surrounded by people willing to say that. At a good college you're concentrated together with a lot of other ambitious and technically minded peopleâ€”probably more concentrated than you'll ever be again. If your nucleus spits out a neutron, there's a good chance it will hit another nucleus. The number one question people ask us at Y Combinator is: Where can I find a co-founder? That's the biggest problem for someone starting a startup at 30. When they were in school they knew a lot of good co-founders, but by 30 they've either lost touch with them or these people are tied down by jobs they don't want to leave. Viaweb was an anomaly in this respect too. Though we were comparatively old, we weren't tied down by impressive jobs. I was trying to be an artist, which is not very constraining, and Robert, though 29, was still in grad school due to a little interruption in his academic career back in 1988. So arguably the Worm made Viaweb possible. Otherwise Robert would have been a junior professor at that age, and he wouldn't have had time to work on crazy speculative projects with me. Most of the questions people ask Y Combinator we have some kind of answer for, but not the co-founder question. There is no good answer. Co-founders really should be people you already know. And by far the best place to meet them is school. You have a large sample of smart people; you get to compare how they all perform on identical tasks; and everyone's life is pretty fluid. A lot of startups grow out of schools for this reason. Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, among others, were all founded by people who met in school. (In Microsoft's case, it was high school.) Many students feel they should wait and get a little more experience before they start a company. All other things being equal, they should. But all other things are not quite as equal as they look. Most students don't realize how rich they are in the scarcest ingredient in startups, co-founders. If you wait too long, you may find that your friends are now involved in some project they don't want to abandon. The better they are, the more likely this is to happen. One way to mitigate this problem might be to actively plan your startup while you're getting those n years of experience. Sure, go off and get jobs or go to grad school or whatever, but get together regularly to scheme, so the idea of starting a startup stays alive in everyone's brain. I don't know if this works, but it can't hurt to try. It would be helpful just to realize what an advantage you have as students. Some of your classmates are probably going to be successful startup founders; at a great technical university, that is a near certainty. So which ones? If I were you I'd look for the people who are not just smart, but incurable builders Look for the people who keep starting projects, and finish at least some of them. That's what we look for. Above all else, above academic credentials and even the idea you apply with, we look for people who build things. The other place co-founders meet is at work. Fewer do than at school, but there are things you can do to improve the odds. The most important, obviously, is to work somewhere that has a lot of smart, young people. Another is to work for a company located in a startup hub. It will be easier to talk a co-worker into quitting with you in a place where startups are happening all around you. You might also want to look at the employment agreement you sign when you get hired. Most will say that any ideas you think of while you're employed by the company belong to them. In practice it's hard for anyone to prove what ideas you had when, so the line gets drawn at code. If you're going to start a startup, don't write any of the code while you're still employed. Or at least discard any code you wrote while still employed and start over. It's not so much that your employer will find out and sue you. It won't come to that; investors or acquirers or (if you're so lucky) underwriters will nail you first.

Robert Morris and I were 29 and 30 respectively when we started Viaweb, but fortunately we still lived like 23 year olds. We both had roughly zero assets. I would have loved to have a mortgage, since that would have meant I had a house But in retrospect having nothing turned out to be convenient. I wasn\\'t tied down and I was used to living cheaply. Even more important than living cheaply, though, is thinking cheaply. One reason the Apple II was so popular was that it was cheap. The computer itself was cheap, and it used cheap, off-the-shelf peripherals like a cassette tape recorder for data storage and a TV as a monitor. And you know why? Because Woz designed this computer for himself, and he couldn\\'t afford anything more. We benefitted from the same phenomenon. Our prices were daringly low for the time. The top level of service was $300 a month, which was an order of magnitude below the norm. In retrospect this was a smart move, but we didn\\'t do it because we were smart. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us. Like Apple, we created something inexpensive, and therefore popular, simply because we were poor. A lot of startups have that form: someone comes along and makes something for a tenth or a hundredth of what it used to cost, and the existing players can\\'t follow because they don\\'t even want to think about a world in which that\\'s possible. Traditional long distance carriers, for example, didn\\'t even want to think about VoIP. (It was coming, all the same.) Being poor helps in this game, because your own personal bias points in the same direction technology evolves in. The advantages of rootlessness are similar to those of poverty. When you\\'re young you\\'re more mobileâ€”not just because you don\\'t have a house or much stuff, but also because you\\'re less likely to have serious relationships. This turns out to be important, because a lot of startups involve someone moving. The founders of Kiko, for example, are now en route to the Bay Area to start their next startup. It\\'s a better place for what they want to do. And it was easy for them to decide to go, because neither as far as I know has a serious girlfriend, and everything they own will fit in one carâ€”or more precisely, will either fit in one car or is crappy enough that they don\\'t mind leaving it behind. They at least were in Boston. What if they\\'d been in Nebraska, like Evan Williams was at their age? Someone wrote recently that the drawback of Y Combinator was that you had to move to participate. It couldn\\'t be any other way. The kind of conversations we have with founders, we have to have in person. We fund a dozen startups at a time, and we can\\'t be in a dozen places at once. But even if we could somehow magically save people from moving, we wouldn\\'t. We wouldn\\'t be doing founders a favor by letting them stay in Nebraska. Places that aren\\'t startup hubs are toxic to startups. You can tell that from indirect evidence. You can tell how hard it must be to start a startup in Houston or Chicago or Miami from the microscopically small number, per capita, that succeed there. I don\\'t know exactly what\\'s suppressing all the startups in these townsâ€”probably a hundred subtle little thingsâ€”but something must be. [ 2 ] Maybe this will change. Maybe the increasing cheapness of startups will mean they\\'ll be able to survive anywhere, instead of only in the most hospitable environments. Maybe 37signals is the pattern for the future. But maybe not. Historically there have always been certain towns that were centers for certain industries, and if you weren\\'t in one of them you were at a disadvantage. So my guess is that 37signals is an anomaly. We\\'re looking at a pattern much older than \"Web 2.0\" here. Perhaps the reason more startups per capita happen in the Bay Area than Miami is simply that there are more founder-type people there. Successful startups are almost never started by one person. Usually they begin with a conversation in which someone mentions that something would be a good idea for a company, and his friend says, \"Yeah, that is a good idea, let\\'s try it.\" If you\\'re missing that second person who says \"let\\'s try it,\" the startup never happens.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=8604, end_char_idx=12900, metadata_seperator='\\n', text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), score=0.8168123253906668), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='83f882dd-1f0b-4cdf-b1d8-15a2d788efbe', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': \"D:\\\\projects\\\\graphrag-poc\\\\data\\\\selection 1\\\\A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_name': \"A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 35856, 'creation_date': '2024-11-26', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-20'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='39dbe197-686f-4596-9478-0f4eb1a4350a', node_type='4', metadata={'file_path': \"D:\\\\projects\\\\graphrag-poc\\\\data\\\\selection 1\\\\A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_name': \"A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 35856, 'creation_date': '2024-11-26', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-20'}, hash='c93d2695e878542a3875974944596c8b180c2788d87dcb71a104c6ec2a8753c2'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='aa827ddf-ff02-46cf-9ba3-75b9becbbb7b', node_type='1', metadata={'file_path': \"D:\\\\projects\\\\graphrag-poc\\\\data\\\\selection 1\\\\A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_name': \"A Student's Guide to Startups (HIVE).txt\", 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 35856, 'creation_date': '2024-11-26', 'last_modified_date': '2024-11-20'}, hash='3cc3de9fc229e67bfe41382a1f0ce2730ccb675bb91b435d1a14771f0158181a'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='54d15917-8683-410b-a7a0-4ebb730a397a', node_type='1', metadata={}, hash='ad215a98214335ccc7d8c93d2cf882ba6ed1433d287bc58de7bd54a049807684')}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text=\"Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\\n\\nStartups -> JUDGE_BY -> Users\\nStartups -> HAVE_ADVANTAGE -> lack of discrimination laws\\nStartups -> MAY_BE_LIMITED_BY -> market size\\nStartups -> WORK_ON -> technology\\nStartups -> THRIVE_IN -> startup hubs\\nStartups -> DESIGNED_FOR -> growth\\nStartups -> CHARACTERIZED_BY -> low cost\\nStartups -> POSE -> financial risk\\nStartups -> HIRE -> people\\nStartups -> LAUNCH -> during YC\\nStartups -> PLAY_GAME_WITH_OUTCOMES -> wealth or failure\\nStartups -> REQUIRE -> funding\\nStartups -> NOT_DESIGNED_FOR -> adversity\\nStartups -> TRANSITION_TO -> VC firms\\nStartups -> PRESENT -> what they've got so far\\nStartups -> LACK -> office hours\\nStartups -> GROW_OUT_OF -> schools\\nStartups -> LOCATED_IN -> Bay Area, Boston, or Seattle\\nStartups -> FAIL_WITHIN -> a year\\nStartups -> INVOLVE -> dealing with challenges\\nStartups -> SUCCEED_BY -> Creating wealth\\nStartups -> NEED -> someone focused on customer needs\\nStartups -> CHARACTERIZED_BY -> blurred work-life boundaries\\nStartups -> RUN_OUT_OF -> money\\nStartups -> OFFER -> solution to financial problems\\nStartups -> REQUIRE -> intense work\\n\\nAnd that is another area where undergrads have an edge.
