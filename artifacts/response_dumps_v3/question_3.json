  "question": "How does the concept of “risk” differ for young founders compared to older founders and investors, and how does this difference shape their decision-making process?",
  "answer": "The provided text highlights a key difference in how risk is perceived and managed by young founders versus older founders and investors.  The text doesn't directly compare older founders' risk assessment to investors', but it does offer insights into the contrasting perspectives of young founders and investors.\n\n1. **Young Founders and Risk:**  The text emphasizes that young founders, particularly those in their early twenties, often possess a unique understanding of risk.  Their perspective is shaped by a clearer understanding of the \"brutal equation\" of work: the necessity of spending most waking hours doing work others want to avoid starvation.  For them, accumulating wealth isn't just about material possessions (like Ferraris); it's primarily about escaping this equation – achieving financial independence and the freedom to choose their work. This understanding fuels their intense drive to succeed, described as the \"energy of a drowning man.\"  They are less concerned with the traditional metrics of success and more focused on achieving user satisfaction and market validation.  The text suggests that this inherent drive mitigates the perceived risk associated with starting a company.  The lower cost of starting a web-based company (primarily food and rent) further reduces the financial risk for young entrepreneurs.\n\n2. **Investors and Risk:**  The text portrays investors as having a different perspective on risk.  They are described as exhibiting \"poor judgment,\" delaying funding, and experiencing \"buyer's remorse.\"  Their decision-making is influenced by factors like a preference for startups with co-founders and an expectation of a clear \"exit strategy.\"  The text suggests investors are risk-averse, focusing on minimizing potential losses rather than maximizing potential gains.  They tend to undervalue young entrepreneurs due to their perceived lack of experience and the difficulty in assessing their potential.  This leads to a situation where the most productive young people are undervalued because their lack of performance history makes it difficult to accurately assess their capabilities.  The text implies that investors often make decisions based on groupthink (\"behave like sheep\"), favoring risky strategies only when they become popular trends.  Their risk assessment is heavily influenced by the perceived average value of young people, rather than recognizing the wide variation in individual capabilities.\n\n3. **Decision-Making Differences:** The contrasting risk perceptions lead to different decision-making processes. Young founders, driven by the desire for financial independence and user validation, are more willing to take risks associated with starting a company, even with limited experience.  Investors, on the other hand, are more cautious, prioritizing established metrics and minimizing potential losses, often overlooking the potential of high-ability young entrepreneurs.  This leads to a mismatch where investors may miss out on opportunities to invest in highly successful ventures founded by young individuals.  The text suggests that the market itself is a more accurate judge of a startup's value than any individual investor or employer.\n\n\nIn summary, young founders view risk through the lens of escaping the drudgery of traditional employment, motivating them to pursue entrepreneurial ventures despite limited experience.  Investors, conversely, approach risk with caution, relying on established metrics and often overlooking the potential of young, high-ability entrepreneurs due to their perceived inexperience and the difficulty in assessing their true potential. This difference in risk perception creates a significant gap in the entrepreneurial landscape, where the market itself often serves as a more accurate evaluator of potential than traditional investors.\n",

        "text": "Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\n\nVenture Capitalists (VCs) (Description: Group of investors who, hypothetically, would have invested in Microsoft if they could have identified Bill Gates' potential earlier.) -> PERCEIVE (Description: The perception of VCs towards young entrepreneurs, potentially viewing them as less serious or reliable.) -> Young Entrepreneurs as Less Reliable (Description: The potential perception of VCs towards young entrepreneurs, potentially viewing them as less serious or reliable.)\nYahoo (Description: One of the three major internet companies in May 2005, alongside Google and Microsoft, notable for its relatively young founders.) -> FOUNDED_BY (Description: Founding of the company by individuals with an average age of 24, as mentioned in the essay.) -> Founders (average age 24) (Description: Group of founders with an average age of 24, used as an example to support the argument for younger entrepreneurs.)\nGoogle (Description: One of the three major internet companies in May 2005, alongside Yahoo and Microsoft, notable for its relatively young founders.) -> FOUNDED_BY (Description: Founding of the company by individuals with an average age of 24, as mentioned in the essay.) -> Founders (average age 24) (Description: Group of founders with an average age of 24, used as an example to support the argument for younger entrepreneurs.)\nMicrosoft (Description: Company that VCs would have hypothetically invested in, illustrating the challenge of early-stage investment.) -> FOUNDED_BY (Description: Founding of the company by individuals with an average age of 24, as mentioned in the essay.) -> Founders (average age 24) (Description: Group of founders with an average age of 24, used as an example to support the argument for younger entrepreneurs.)\n\nMay 2005 (This essay is derived from a talk at the Berkeley CSUA.) The three big powers on the Internet now are Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft. Average age of their founders: 24. So it is pretty well established now that grad students can start successful companies. And if grad students can do it, why not undergrads? Like everything else in technology, the cost of starting a startup has decreased dramatically. Now it's so low that it has disappeared into the noise. The main cost of starting a Web-based startup is food and rent. Which means it doesn't cost much more to start a company than to be a total slacker. You can probably start a startup on ten thousand dollars of seed funding, if you're prepared to live on ramen. The less it costs to start a company, the less you need the permission of investors to do it. So a lot of people will be able to start companies now who never could have before. The most interesting subset may be those in their early twenties. I'm not so excited about founders who have everything investors want except intelligence, or everything except energy. The most promising group to be liberated by the new, lower threshold are those who have everything investors want except experience. Market Rate I once claimed that nerds were unpopular in secondary school mainly because they had better things to do than work full-time at being popular. Some said I was just telling people what they wanted to hear. Well, I'm now about to do that in a spectacular way: I think undergraduates are undervalued. Or more precisely, I think few realize the huge spread in the value of 20 year olds. Some, it's true, are not very capable. But others are more capable than all but a handful of 30 year olds. [ 1 ] Till now the problem has always been that it's difficult to pick them out. Every VC in the world, if they could go back in time, would try to invest in Microsoft. But which would have then? How many would have understood that this particular 19 year old was Bill Gates? It's hard to judge the young because (a) they change rapidly, (b) there is great variation between them, and (c) they're individually inconsistent. That last one is a big problem. When you're young, you occasionally say and do stupid things even when you're smart. So if the algorithm is to filter out people who say stupid things, as many investors and employers unconsciously do, you're going to get a lot of false positives. Most organizations who hire people right out of college are only aware of the average value of 22 year olds, which is not that high. And so the idea for most of the twentieth century was that everyone had to begin as a trainee in some entry-level job. Organizations realized there was a lot of variation in the incoming stream, but instead of pursuing this thought they tended to suppress it, in the belief that it was good for even the most promising kids to start at the bottom, so they didn't get swelled heads. The most productive young people will always be undervalued by large organizations, because the young have no performance to measure yet, and any error in guessing their ability will tend toward the mean. What's an especially productive 22 year old to do? One thing you can do is go over the heads of organizations, directly to the users. Any company that hires you is, economically, acting as a proxy for the customer. The rate at which they value you (though they may not consciously realize it) is an attempt to guess your value to the user. But there's a way to appeal their judgement. If you want, you can opt to be valued directly by users, by starting your own company. The market is a lot more discerning than any employer. And it is completely non-discriminatory. On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog. And more to the point, nobody knows you're 22. All users care about is whether your site or software gives them what they want. They don't care if the person behind it is a high school kid. If you're really productive, why not make employers pay market rate for you? Why go work as an ordinary employee for a big company, when you could start a startup and make them buy it to get you? When most people hear the word \"startup,\" they think of the famous ones that have gone public. But most startups that succeed do it by getting bought. And usually the acquirer doesn't just want the technology, but the people who created it as well.",

The market doesn't give a shit how hard you worked. Users just want your software to do what they need, and you get a zero otherwise. That is one of the most distinctive differences between school and the real world: there is no reward for putting in a good effort. In fact, the whole concept of a \"good effort\" is a fake idea adults invented to encourage kids. It is not found in nature. Such lies seem to be helpful to kids. But unfortunately when you graduate they don't give you a list of all the lies they told you during your education. You have to get them beaten out of you by contact with the real world. And this is why so many jobs want work experience. I couldn't understand that when I was in college. I knew how to program. In fact, I could tell I knew how to program better than most people doing it for a living. So what was this mysterious \"work experience\" and why did I need it? Now I know what it is, and part of the confusion is grammatical. Describing it as \"work experience\" implies it's like experience operating a certain kind of machine, or using a certain programming language. But really what work experience refers to is not some specific expertise, but the elimination of certain habits left over from childhood. One of the defining qualities of kids is that they flake. When you're a kid and you face some hard test, you can cry and say \"I can't\" and they won't make you do it. Of course, no one can make you do anything in the grownup world either. What they do instead is fire you. And when motivated by that you find you can do a lot more than you realized. So one of the things employers expect from someone with \"work experience\" is the elimination of the flake reflexâ€”the ability to get things done, with no excuses. The other thing you get from work experience is an understanding of what work is, and in particular, how intrinsically horrible it is. Fundamentally the equation is a brutal one: you have to spend most of your waking hours doing stuff someone else wants, or starve. There are a few places where the work is so interesting that this is concealed, because what other people want done happens to coincide with what you want to work on. But you only have to imagine what would happen if they diverged to see the underlying reality. It's not so much that adults lie to kids about this as never explain it. They never explain what the deal is with money. You know from an early age that you'll have some sort of job, because everyone asks what you're going to \"be\" when you grow up. What they don't tell you is that as a kid you're sitting on the shoulders of someone else who's treading water, and that starting working means you get thrown into the water on your own, and have to start treading water yourself or sink. \"Being\" something is incidental; the immediate problem is not to drown. The relationship between work and money tends to dawn on you only gradually. At least it did for me. One's first thought tends to be simply \"This sucks. I'm in debt. Plus I have to get up on monday and go to work.\" Gradually you realize that these two things are as tightly connected as only a market can make them. So the most important advantage 24 year old founders have over 20 year old founders is that they know what they're trying to avoid. To the average undergrad the idea of getting rich translates into buying Ferraris, or being admired. To someone who has learned from experience about the relationship between money and work, it translates to something way more important: it means you get to opt out of the brutal equation that governs the lives of 99.9% of people. Getting rich means you can stop treading water. Someone who gets this will work much harder at making a startup succeedâ€”with the proverbial energy of a drowning man, in fact. But understanding the relationship between money and work also changes the way you work. You don't get money just for working, but for doing things other people want. Someone who's figured that out will automatically focus more on the user. And that cures the other half of the class-project syndrome. After you've been working for a while, you yourself tend to measure what you've done the same way the market does.",
