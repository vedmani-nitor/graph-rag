  "question": "What are the advantages and disadvantages of starting a startup right out of college?",
  "answer": "Based on the provided text, here's an analysis of the advantages and disadvantages of starting a startup immediately after college:\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n1. **Lower Living Costs:** Recent graduates often have lower living expenses than older founders with families and mortgages. This allows them to allocate more resources to the startup, as the primary cost in software startups is personnel.  The text uses the example of a 25-year-old versus a 32-year-old, highlighting the financial advantage of the younger founder.  Even living like a 23-year-old, as the author did, proves beneficial.\n\n2. **\"Thinking Cheaply\":**  The author argues that being poor fosters a mindset of resourcefulness and innovation, leading to the creation of inexpensive and popular products. This is exemplified by the success of the Apple II, which was designed affordably, and Viaweb, which offered daringly low prices. This \"thinking cheaply\" aligns with technological evolution, creating a competitive advantage.\n\n3. **Increased Mobility and Flexibility:**  Youth often correlates with greater mobility, both physically and relationally.  The founders of Kiko easily relocated to the Bay Area for better opportunities, unburdened by significant possessions or serious relationships. This contrasts with the challenges faced by someone already established in a less favorable location, like Evan Williams in Nebraska.  The author emphasizes that startup hubs are crucial for success, and being young and unattached facilitates relocation to these environments.\n\n4. **Peer Pressure as Motivation:** The text highlights the powerful influence of peer opinion, especially among those in similar situations.  Graduating and starting a startup removes the \"escape hatch\" of returning to school if the venture fails. This increased pressure, while potentially stressful, can serve as a strong motivator to succeed.  The author uses the example of Prototype Day at Y Combinator to illustrate this point.\n\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n\n1. **Increased Pressure and Lack of Escape Route:**  While peer pressure can be motivating, it also creates significant pressure.  Starting a startup after graduation removes the safety net of returning to school if the venture fails.  The author explicitly states that this lack of an escape hatch increases the pressure to succeed.\n\n2. **Geographic Limitations:** While youth offers mobility, the text also highlights the importance of being located in a startup hub.  The author argues that locations outside these hubs are \"toxic\" to startups, implying a significant disadvantage for those unable or unwilling to relocate.\n\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe decision to start a startup immediately after college presents a trade-off between financial and personal advantages (lower living costs, increased mobility, and heightened peer pressure) and the increased pressure and potential geographic limitations.  The author emphasizes the importance of considering these factors carefully, as the success of a startup is a close call even for those who succeed.  The text suggests that the advantages of youth and lower living costs can be significant, but the lack of an escape hatch and the importance of geographic location must also be considered.\n",

The guys with kids and mortgages are at a real disadvantage. This is one reason I'd bet on the 25 year old over the 32 year old. The 32 year old probably is a better programmer, but probably also has a much more expensive life. Whereas a 25 year old has some work experience (more on that later) but can live as cheaply as an undergrad. Robert Morris and I were 29 and 30 respectively when we started Viaweb, but fortunately we still lived like 23 year olds. We both had roughly zero assets. I would have loved to have a mortgage, since that would have meant I had a house But in retrospect having nothing turned out to be convenient. I wasn't tied down and I was used to living cheaply. Even more important than living cheaply, though, is thinking cheaply. One reason the Apple II was so popular was that it was cheap. The computer itself was cheap, and it used cheap, off-the-shelf peripherals like a cassette tape recorder for data storage and a TV as a monitor. And you know why? Because Woz designed this computer for himself, and he couldn't afford anything more. We benefitted from the same phenomenon. Our prices were daringly low for the time. The top level of service was $300 a month, which was an order of magnitude below the norm. In retrospect this was a smart move, but we didn't do it because we were smart. $300 a month seemed like a lot of money to us. Like Apple, we created something inexpensive, and therefore popular, simply because we were poor. A lot of startups have that form: someone comes along and makes something for a tenth or a hundredth of what it used to cost, and the existing players can't follow because they don't even want to think about a world in which that's possible. Traditional long distance carriers, for example, didn't even want to think about VoIP. (It was coming, all the same.) Being poor helps in this game, because your own personal bias points in the same direction technology evolves in. The advantages of rootlessness are similar to those of poverty. When you're young you're more mobileâ€”not just because you don't have a house or much stuff, but also because you're less likely to have serious relationships. This turns out to be important, because a lot of startups involve someone moving. The founders of Kiko, for example, are now en route to the Bay Area to start their next startup. It's a better place for what they want to do. And it was easy for them to decide to go, because neither as far as I know has a serious girlfriend, and everything they own will fit in one carâ€”or more precisely, will either fit in one car or is crappy enough that they don't mind leaving it behind. They at least were in Boston. What if they'd been in Nebraska, like Evan Williams was at their age? Someone wrote recently that the drawback of Y Combinator was that you had to move to participate. It couldn't be any other way. The kind of conversations we have with founders, we have to have in person. We fund a dozen startups at a time, and we can't be in a dozen places at once. But even if we could somehow magically save people from moving, we wouldn't. We wouldn't be doing founders a favor by letting them stay in Nebraska. Places that aren't startup hubs are toxic to startups. You can tell that from indirect evidence. You can tell how hard it must be to start a startup in Houston or Chicago or Miami from the microscopically small number, per capita, that succeed there. I don't know exactly what's suppressing all the startups in these townsâ€”probably a hundred subtle little thingsâ€”but something must be. [ 2 ] Maybe this will change. Maybe the increasing cheapness of startups will mean they'll be able to survive anywhere, instead of only in the most hospitable environments. Maybe 37signals is the pattern for the future. But maybe not. Historically there have always been certain towns that were centers for certain industries, and if you weren't in one of them you were at a disadvantage. So my guess is that 37signals is an anomaly. We're looking at a pattern much older than \"Web 2.0\" here.",

        "text": "Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\n\nGraduating Seniors (Description: Students graduating from college, traditionally facing the choices of employment or graduate school.) -> HAVE_OPTION (Description: Options available to graduating seniors, increasingly including starting a startup.) -> Start a Startup (Description: A career path increasingly considered by graduating seniors as a viable alternative to traditional options.)\n\nOctober 2006 (This essay is derived from a talk at MIT.) Till recently graduating seniors had two choices: get a job or go to grad school. I think there will increasingly be a third option: to start your own startup. But how common will that be? I'm sure the default will always be to get a job, but starting a startup could well become as popular as grad school. In the late 90s my professor friends used to complain that they couldn't get grad students, because all the undergrads were going to work for startups. I wouldn't be surprised if that situation returns, but with one difference: this time they'll be starting their own instead of going to work for other people's. The most ambitious students will at this point be asking: Why wait till you graduate? Why not start a startup while you're in college? In fact, why go to college at all? Why not start a startup instead? A year and a half ago I gave a talk where I said that the average age of the founders of Yahoo, Google, and Microsoft was 24, and that if grad students could start startups, why not undergrads? I'm glad I phrased that as a question, because now I can pretend it wasn't merely a rhetorical one. At the time I couldn't imagine why there should be any lower limit for the age of startup founders. Graduation is a bureaucratic change, not a biological one. And certainly there are undergrads as competent technically as most grad students. So why shouldn't undergrads be able to start startups as well as grad students? I now realize that something does change at graduation: you lose a huge excuse for failing. Regardless of how complex your life is, you'll find that everyone else, including your family and friends, will discard all the low bits and regard you as having a single occupation at any given time. If you're in college and have a summer job writing software, you still read as a student. Whereas if you graduate and get a job programming, you'll be instantly regarded by everyone as a programmer. The problem with starting a startup while you're still in school is that there's a built-in escape hatch. If you start a startup in the summer between your junior and senior year, it reads to everyone as a summer job. So if it goes nowhere, big deal; you return to school in the fall with all the other seniors; no one regards you as a failure, because your occupation is student, and you didn't fail at that. Whereas if you start a startup just one year later, after you graduate, as long as you're not accepted to grad school in the fall the startup reads to everyone as your occupation. You're now a startup founder, so you have to do well at that. For nearly everyone, the opinion of one's peers is the most powerful motivator of allâ€”more powerful even than the nominal goal of most startup founders, getting rich. [ 1 ] About a month into each funding cycle we have an event called Prototype Day where each startup presents to the others what they've got so far. You might think they wouldn't need any more motivation. They're working on their cool new idea; they have funding for the immediate future; and they're playing a game with only two outcomes: wealth or failure. You'd think that would be motivation enough. And yet the prospect of a demo pushes most of them into a rush of activity. Even if you start a startup explicitly to get rich, the money you might get seems pretty theoretical most of the time. What drives you day to day is not wanting to look bad. You probably can't change that. Even if you could, I don't think you'd want to; someone who really, truly doesn't care what his peers think of him is probably a psychopath. So the best you can do is consider this force like a wind, and set up your boat accordingly. If you know your peers are going to push you in some direction, choose good peers, and position yourself so they push you in a direction you like. Graduation changes the prevailing winds, and those make a difference. Starting a startup is so hard that it's a close call even for the ones that succeed. However high a startup may be flying now, it probably has a few leaves stuck in the landing gear from those trees it barely cleared at the end of the runway. In such a close game, the smallest increase in the forces against you can be enough to flick you over the edge into failure. When we first started Y Combinator we encouraged people to start startups while they were still in college.",
