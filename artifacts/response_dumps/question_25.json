  "question": "How does the history of wealth creation, from inheritance to industrialization to the rise of tech startups, reflect changes in technology and economic structures?",
  "answer": "This analysis examines how the sources of wealth among the richest Americans have shifted from 1982 to 2020, reflecting changes in technology and economic structures.\n\n1. **Inheritance's Decline:** In 1982, inheritance was the primary source of wealth for the top 100 richest Americans, with 60 individuals inheriting their fortunes [1].  By 2020, this number decreased to 27, not due to increased inheritance taxes (which actually decreased), but because more people were creating their own wealth [1]. This shift indicates a move away from inherited wealth towards self-made fortunes.\n\n2. **The Rise of Company Founding:**  In 2020, approximately three-quarters of the 73 new fortunes among the richest Americans stemmed from founding companies, primarily technology companies [1]. This contrasts sharply with 1982, where oil and real estate were the dominant sources of new wealth, accounting for at least 24 out of 40 new fortunes [1].  This dramatic change highlights the impact of technological advancements on wealth creation.\n\n3. **Technological Advancements and Startup Costs:** The text explains that technology has significantly reduced the cost of building products and acquiring customers, making it cheaper to start a company [8]. This decrease in the cost of starting a startup has shifted the power dynamic between founders and investors, with investors now needing founders more than vice versa [8].  This, combined with increased venture capital, has driven up valuations [8].  Furthermore, technology has accelerated the speed of product development and distribution, leading to faster growth for newly founded companies [8].  This faster growth increases the value of founders' stock, as company value is a function of revenue and growth rate [8].  The combination of lower startup costs and faster growth explains why founders can become wealthy more quickly.\n\n4. **The Role of Tech Companies:**  In 2020, approximately 30 of the 73 new fortunes originated from \"tech\" companies, with 8 of the top 10 fortunes falling into this category [1]. These companies are characterized by their technological advantage, attracting venture capital investment [1].  This signifies a qualitative shift from wealth creation based on resource extraction (oil and real estate) to wealth creation driven by technological innovation.\n\nIn summary, the evolution of wealth creation reflects a transition from an inheritance-based system to one dominated by company founding, particularly in the technology sector. This shift is directly linked to technological advancements that have reduced startup costs, accelerated growth rates, and created new opportunities for wealth generation.  The rise of tech companies represents a fundamental change in the economic landscape and the sources of significant wealth.\n\n\nCitations:\n1.

        "text": "Here are some facts extracted from the provided text:\n\nTechnology (Description: Technological advancements that have not only reduced the cost but also accelerated the speed of product development and distribution, impacting the growth trajectory of startups.) -> ACCELERATE (Description: The impact of technology on the growth rate of newly founded companies, leading to faster revenue generation and increased valuation.) -> Growth of newly founded companies (Description: The rate at which startups generate revenue and expand their operations, significantly influenced by technological advancements.)\nTechnology (Description: Technological advancements that have not only reduced the cost but also accelerated the speed of product development and distribution, impacting the growth trajectory of startups.) -> ACCELERATE (Description: The impact of technology on the growth rate of newly founded companies, leading to faster revenue generation and increased valuation.) -> Growth of newly founded companies (Description: The rate at which startups generate revenue and expand their operations, significantly influenced by technological advancements.)\nTechnology (Description: Technological advancements that have not only reduced the cost but also accelerated the speed of product development and distribution, impacting the growth trajectory of startups.) -> DECREASE (Description: Reduction in the cost of building products and acquiring customers, leading to a shift in power dynamics between founders and investors in the startup ecosystem.) -> Cost of starting a startup (Description: The overall expense associated with establishing a new company, significantly influenced by technological progress in product development and customer acquisition.)\nTechnology (Description: Technological advancements that have not only reduced the cost but also accelerated the speed of product development and distribution, impacting the growth trajectory of startups.) -> DECREASE (Description: Reduction in the cost of building products and acquiring customers, leading to a shift in power dynamics between founders and investors in the startup ecosystem.) -> Cost of starting a startup (Description: The overall expense associated with establishing a new company, significantly influenced by technological progress in product development and customer acquisition.)\n\nBut the main reason it's easier to start a startup now is that it's cheaper. Technology has driven down the cost of both building products and acquiring customers. The decreasing cost of starting a startup has in turn changed the balance of power between founders and investors. Back when starting a startup meant building a factory, you needed investors' permission to do it at all. But now investors need founders more than founders need investors, and that, combined with the increasing amount of venture capital available, has driven up valuations. [ 8 ] So the decreasing cost of starting a startup increases the number of rich people in two ways: it means that more people start them, and that those who do can raise money on better terms. But there's also a third factor at work: the companies themselves are more valuable, because newly founded companies grow faster than they used to. Technology hasn't just made it cheaper to build and distribute things, but faster too. This trend has been running for a long time. IBM, founded in 1896, took 45 years to reach a billion 2020 dollars in revenue. Hewlett-Packard, founded in 1939, took 25 years. Microsoft, founded in 1975, took 13 years. Now the norm for fast-growing companies is 7 or 8 years. [ 9 ] Fast growth has a double effect on the value of founders' stock. The value of a company is a function of its revenue and its growth rate. So if a company grows faster, you not only get to a billion dollars in revenue sooner, but the company is more valuable when it reaches that point than it would be if it were growing slower. That's why founders sometimes get so rich so young now. The low initial cost of starting a startup means founders can start young, and the fast growth of companies today means that if they succeed they could be surprisingly rich just a few years later. It's easier now to start and grow a company than it has ever been. That means more people start them, that those who do get better terms from investors, and that the resulting companies become more valuable. Once you understand how these mechanisms work, and that startups were suppressed for most of the 20th century, you don't have to resort to some vague right turn the country took under Reagan to explain why America's Gini coefficient is increasing. Of course the Gini coefficient is increasing. With more people starting more valuable companies, how could it not be? Notes [ 1 ] Investment firms grew rapidly after a regulatory change by the Labor Department in 1978 allowed pension funds to invest in them, but the effects of this growth were not yet visible in the top 100 fortunes in 1982. [ 2 ] George Mitchell deserves mention as an exception. Though really driven and good at making deals, he was also the first to figure out how to use fracking to get natural gas out of shale. [ 3 ] When I say people are starting more companies, I mean the type of company meant to grow very big. There has actually been a decrease in the last couple decades in the overall number of new companies. But the vast majority of companies are small retail and service businesses. So what the statistics about the decreasing number of new businesses mean is that people are starting fewer shoe stores and barber shops. People sometimes get confused when they see a graph labelled \"startups\" that's going down, because there are two senses of the word \"startup\": (1) the founding of a company, and (2) a particular type of company designed to grow big fast. The statistics mean startup in sense (1), not sense (2). [ 4 ] Rockoff, Hugh. \"Great Fortunes of the Gilded Age.\" NBER Working Paper 14555, 2008. [ 5 ] Lind, Michael. Land of Promise. HarperCollins, 2012. It's also likely that the high tax rates in the mid 20th century deterred people from starting their own companies. Starting one's own company is risky, and when risk isn't rewarded, people opt for safety instead. But it wasn't simply cause and effect. The oligopolies and high tax rates of the mid 20th century were all of a piece.",

After you've been working for a while, you yourself tend to measure what you've done the same way the market does. Of course, you don't have to spend years working to learn this stuff. If you're sufficiently perceptive you can grasp these things while you're still in school. Sam Altman did. He must have, because Loopt is no class project. And as his example suggests, this can be valuable knowledge. At a minimum, if you get this stuff, you already have most of what you gain from the \"work experience\" employers consider so desirable. But of course if you really get it, you can use this information in a way that's more valuable to you than that. Now So suppose you think you might start a startup at some point, either when you graduate or a few years after. What should you do now? For both jobs and grad school, there are ways to prepare while you're in college. If you want to get a job when you graduate, you should get summer jobs at places you'd like to work. If you want to go to grad school, it will help to work on research projects as an undergrad. What's the equivalent for startups? How do you keep your options maximally open? One thing you can do while you're still in school is to learn how startups work. Unfortunately that's not easy. Few if any colleges have classes about startups. There may be business school classes on entrepreneurship, as they call it over there, but these are likely to be a waste of time. Business schools like to talk about startups, but philosophically they're at the opposite end of the spectrum. Most books on startups also seem to be useless. I've looked at a few and none get it right. Books in most fields are written by people who know the subject from experience, but for startups there's a unique problem: by definition the founders of successful startups don't need to write books to make money. As a result most books on the subject end up being written by people who don't understand it. So I'd be skeptical of classes and books. The way to learn about startups is by watching them in action, preferably by working at one. How do you do that as an undergrad? Probably by sneaking in through the back door. Just hang around a lot and gradually start doing things for them. Most startups are (or should be) very cautious about hiring. Every hire increases the burn rate, and bad hires early on are hard to recover from. However, startups usually have a fairly informal atmosphere, and there's always a lot that needs to be done. If you just start doing stuff for them, many will be too busy to shoo you away. You can thus gradually work your way into their confidence, and maybe turn it into an official job later, or not, whichever you prefer. This won't work for all startups, but it would work for most I've known. Number two, make the most of the great advantage of school: the wealth of co-founders. Look at the people around you and ask yourself which you'd like to work with. When you apply that test, you may find you get surprising results. You may find you'd prefer the quiet guy you've mostly ignored to someone who seems impressive but has an attitude to match. I'm not suggesting you suck up to people you don't really like because you think one day they'll be successful. Exactly the opposite, in fact: you should only start a startup with someone you like, because a startup will put your friendship through a stress test. I'm just saying you should think about who you really admire and hang out with them, instead of whoever circumstances throw you together with. Another thing you can do is learn skills that will be useful to you in a startup. These may be different from the skills you'd learn to get a job. For example, thinking about getting a job will make you want to learn programming languages you think employers want, like Java and C++. Whereas if you start a startup, you get to pick the language, so you have to think about which will actually let you get the most done. If you use that test you might end up learning Ruby or Python instead. But the most important skill for a startup founder isn't a programming technique. It's a knack for understanding users and figuring out how to give them what they want. I know I repeat this, but that's because it's so important. And it's a skill you can learn, though perhaps habit might be a better word.",

If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to the 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences. In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the 100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10 du Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes. Why would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance taxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this period. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more people are making them. How are people making these new fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting companies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56 derive from founders' or early employees' equity (52 founders, 2 early employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managing investment funds. There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982. Hedge funds and private equity firms existed in 1982, but none of their founders were rich enough yet to make it into the top 100. Two things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generate high returns, and more investors were willing to trust them with their money. [ 1 ] But the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, and when you look at the data, you see big changes there too. People get richer from starting companies now than they did in 1982, because the companies do different things. In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and real estate. Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due primarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number are: of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2 to oil. By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes called \"tech\" companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive from such companies. These are particularly common among the richest of the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of this type. Arguably it's slightly misleading to treat tech as a category. Isn't Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no. Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it won't seem right to put these two businesses in the same category. But at the moment at least, there is definitely something they share in common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? What car maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company? The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a well-differentiated group in the sense that they're all companies that venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others mostly not. And there's a reason why: these are mostly companies that win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who's really driven and good at making deals. To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative change. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400 didn't win by making better technology. They won by being really driven and good at making deals. [ 2 ] And indeed, that way of getting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution. The courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of European royal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule, really driven and good at making deals. People who don't look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn't get as rich. But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don't look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies? Why are people starting so many more new companies than they used to, and why are they getting so rich from it? The answer to the first question, curiously enough, is that it's misphrased.",
