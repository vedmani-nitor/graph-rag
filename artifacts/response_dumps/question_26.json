  "question": "How has the landscape of wealth creation in America shifted between 1982 and 2020, and what technological factors have contributed to this shift?",
  "answer": "The landscape of wealth creation in America underwent a significant shift between 1982 and 2020, moving away from inheritance and traditional industries towards company founding, particularly within the technology sector.\n\n1. **Shift in Sources of Wealth:** In 1982, inheritance was the primary source of wealth for the richest Americans, with 60 out of the top 100 inheriting their fortunes [1].  Oil and real estate were the dominant sources of *new* wealth, accounting for at least 24 out of 40 new fortunes [1]. By 2020, this landscape had dramatically changed.  Inheritance accounted for only 27 of the top 100 fortunes [1], while company founding became the primary source of new wealth, responsible for approximately three-quarters (56 out of 73) of new fortunes [1].  This was largely driven by technology companies, with about 30 of the 73 new fortunes stemming from \"tech\" companies [1].  Furthermore, while hedge fund and private equity managers were absent from the 1982 list, they accounted for 17 of the 73 new fortunes in 2020 [1].  Oil and real estate's contribution to new wealth significantly diminished, with only 6 out of 73 new fortunes attributed to these sectors in 2020 [1].\n\n2. **Technological Factors:** The rise of technology companies as a major source of new wealth is a key factor in this shift.  The text highlights that approximately 30 of the 73 new fortunes in 2020 originated from \"tech\" companies [1],  including 8 of the top 10 fortunes [1].  These companies, while sometimes categorized broadly as \"tech,\" are distinguished by their reliance on technological innovation and their attractiveness to venture capitalists [1].  The text contrasts this with the wealth creation methods of 1982, where success was largely based on \"being really driven and good at making deals,\" a method predating the Industrial Revolution [2].  The emergence of companies that succeed through technological advancement, rather than solely through deal-making, represents a \"qualitative change\" [2].\n\nIn summary, the American landscape of wealth creation shifted dramatically between 1982 and 2020.  Inheritance's role diminished significantly, while company founding, especially within the technology sector, became the dominant force. This shift reflects a change in the methods of wealth creation, moving from traditional industries and inheritance to a model driven by technological innovation and venture capital investment.\n\n\nCitations:\n1.

If we compare the 100 richest people in 1982 to the 100 richest in 2020, we notice some big differences. In 1982 the most common source of wealth was inheritance. Of the 100 richest people, 60 inherited from an ancestor. There were 10 du Pont heirs alone. By 2020 the number of heirs had been cut in half, accounting for only 27 of the biggest 100 fortunes. Why would the percentage of heirs decrease? Not because inheritance taxes increased. In fact, they decreased significantly during this period. The reason the percentage of heirs has decreased is not that fewer people are inheriting great fortunes, but that more people are making them. How are people making these new fortunes? Roughly 3/4 by starting companies and 1/4 by investing. Of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 56 derive from founders' or early employees' equity (52 founders, 2 early employees, and 2 wives of founders), and 17 from managing investment funds. There were no fund managers among the 100 richest Americans in 1982. Hedge funds and private equity firms existed in 1982, but none of their founders were rich enough yet to make it into the top 100. Two things changed: fund managers discovered new ways to generate high returns, and more investors were willing to trust them with their money. [ 1 ] But the main source of new fortunes now is starting companies, and when you look at the data, you see big changes there too. People get richer from starting companies now than they did in 1982, because the companies do different things. In 1982, there were two dominant sources of new wealth: oil and real estate. Of the 40 new fortunes in 1982, at least 24 were due primarily to oil or real estate. Now only a small number are: of the 73 new fortunes in 2020, 4 were due to real estate and only 2 to oil. By 2020 the biggest source of new wealth was what are sometimes called \"tech\" companies. Of the 73 new fortunes, about 30 derive from such companies. These are particularly common among the richest of the rich: 8 of the top 10 fortunes in 2020 were new fortunes of this type. Arguably it's slightly misleading to treat tech as a category. Isn't Amazon really a retailer, and Tesla a car maker? Yes and no. Maybe in 50 years, when what we call tech is taken for granted, it won't seem right to put these two businesses in the same category. But at the moment at least, there is definitely something they share in common that distinguishes them. What retailer starts AWS? What car maker is run by someone who also has a rocket company? The tech companies behind the top 100 fortunes also form a well-differentiated group in the sense that they're all companies that venture capitalists would readily invest in, and the others mostly not. And there's a reason why: these are mostly companies that win by having better technology, rather than just a CEO who's really driven and good at making deals. To that extent, the rise of the tech companies represents a qualitative change. The oil and real estate magnates of the 1982 Forbes 400 didn't win by making better technology. They won by being really driven and good at making deals. [ 2 ] And indeed, that way of getting rich is so old that it predates the Industrial Revolution. The courtiers who got rich in the (nominal) service of European royal houses in the 16th and 17th centuries were also, as a rule, really driven and good at making deals. People who don't look any deeper than the Gini coefficient look back on the world of 1982 as the good old days, because those who got rich then didn't get as rich. But if you dig into how they got rich, the old days don't look so good. In 1982, 84% of the richest 100 people got rich by inheritance, extracting natural resources, or doing real estate deals. Is that really better than a world in which the richest people get rich by starting tech companies? Why are people starting so many more new companies than they used to, and why are they getting so rich from it? The answer to the first question, curiously enough, is that it's misphrased.",
